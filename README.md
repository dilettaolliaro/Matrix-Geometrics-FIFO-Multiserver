# Matrix-Geometrics-FIFO-Multiserver

This MATLAB code repository is dedicated to analysing the performance of the Multiserver-Job-Queueing-Model, under a First-In-First-Out scheduling policy with 2 classes of jobs. This numerical method is based on a Matrix Geometrics approach, providing insights into the system behaviour and dynamics.
One of the main difficulties of this Matrix Geometrics method lies in the computation of matrix R, a pivotal step facilitated by SMCSolver—a robust MATLAB Toolbox designed for solving M/G/1, GI/M/1, and Non-Skip-Free type Markov chains [1]. Leveraging cutting-edge algorithms, SMCSolver stands, at the best of our knowledge, as the forefront solution in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Functions and utilities from SMCSolver MATLAB Toolbox are contained in the MG1 folder.
